class doppler_compensation(gr.hier_block2):
    """ Doppler compensation and resampling block

    This block performs Doppler compensation and resampling.
    Rather than using directly the available Doppler correction blocks,
    based on the user parameters of the incoming sampling rate and the 
    desired target sampling rate, it applies proper decimation on the signal
    so the frequency shift to be applied to a smaller sampling rate,
    reducing significantly the CPU resources required. At the previous 
    architecture (gr-satnogs 1.x.x) we used seperate blocks for the doppler
    correction and the LO digital shift, operating at the device sampling rate.
    These two blocks, performing almost the same operation, contributed to a
    30% CPU usage of the overall application. Now the LO is compensated by
    the Doppler correction block, taking into account at the same time the
    Doppler drift.
    
    After the digital LO shift, the Doppler corrected signal is passed through
    an Polyphase Arbitrary Resampler, to match exactly the sampling rate
    requested by the user.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    samp_rate : double
        The sampling rate of the input signal
    sat_freq : double
        The target frequency of the satellite. This highly depends on the 
        Doppler frequency messages. Some blocks (e.g rigctld) may produce 
        the target observed RF frequency, whereas others (e.g gr-leo) are 
        sending messages containing only the frequency drift. In the first 
        case, this field should contain the actual frequency of the satellite.
        On the other hand, for the second case this field should be 0.
    lo_offset : double
        The LO offset from the actual observation frequency. In most cases,
        we use a LO offset to avoid the DC spikes. This offset should be positive
        if the hardware RF frequency is less than the target frequency, negative
        otherwise.
    compensate : bool
        This parameter instructs the Doppler correction block to apply Doppler
        compensation. The LO offset compensation is still applied regardless of
        the value of this field.
    fine_correction : bool
        This parameters defines which Doppler correction mechanism will be used.
        If set to False the coarse method is used that salters the frequency
        with the frequency offset received at the message queue with the name
        Doppler. If set to True, a curve fitting engine is added to the 
        coarse Doppler correction mechanism.
