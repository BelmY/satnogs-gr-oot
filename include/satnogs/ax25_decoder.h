 * \brief AX.25 decoder that supports the legacy hardware radios.
 *
 * This block takes as input a quadrature demodulated bit stream.
 * Each byte should contains only one bit of information at the LSB.
 *
 * The block will try to find an AX.25 frame. If the frame pass the
 * CRC check then a blob PMT message is produced at the message output
 * indicated with name 'out'. Otherwise if the frame did not pass the
 * CRC check or the size was invalid, a blob PMT message is generated at
 * the output port with the name 'fail'. This will help to recover at least
 * some bytes from a corrupted message.
 *
 * The block also supports destination callsign check. Only frames with
 * the right destination Callsign will be accepted. This feature can be
 * disabled using the promisc parameter.
